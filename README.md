Perhaps the world really does need another Git guide. Perhaps, I'm crazy too!

The goal of this guide is to give users an easy introduction to using git and GitHub for developing _[Snap!][snap]_ ([repo][repo]). The focus will be users with basic programming experience, but with little experience of version control systems. While it will be somewhat specific to our development process, especially the examples!, I hope you'll find most of it useful still! :) So, read up, my friend:
